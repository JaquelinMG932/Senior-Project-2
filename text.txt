Sentiment analysis is a subfield of natural language processing (NLP) that involves using algorithms to identify and extract subjective information from text data, such as opinions, emotions, and attitudes. The goal of sentiment analysis is to automatically determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text and categorize it as positive, negative, or neutral.

Polarity and subjectivity are two key concepts in sentiment analysis that are closely related. Polarity refers to the degree of positivity or negativity expressed in a piece of text, while subjectivity refers to the degree to which a piece of text expresses a personal opinion or emotion. In sentiment analysis, polarity is often used to categorize the sentiment of a piece of text as positive, negative, or neutral, while subjectivity is used to determine whether a piece of text is subjective or objective.

The use of sentiment analysis has grown significantly over the years, with many businesses using it to gain insights into their customers' opinions and preferences. Sentiment analysis can be used to analyze social media posts, product reviews, customer feedback, and even news articles. It provides businesses with valuable insights into what their customers are saying about them, their products, and their competitors.

Likewise we have chosen to use sentiment analysis for it's growing popularity and for this project we have incorporated it into finding the sentiments of a topic, hashtag or relevant words that are then analyzed. From here graphs are generated to represent the numerical data into a easy to read format that is then being transported to this report.
